### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Abeer Khan and welcome to my profile! Here's a few little tidbits about me:
- I'm currently studying as a Computer Science student at Habib University.
- Primary fields of interest in CS are computational social sciences, web-development, artificial and computational intelligence.
- Besides CS, I'm interested in architecture, film, music, and fashion. I do a little bit of screenwriting, and graphic designing on the side, when I have some free time.
